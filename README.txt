  Citrus is a test framework written in Java that is able to create 
  fully automated end-to-end use case tests for enterprise SOA 
  applications. Citrus simulates surrounding interface partners 
  supporting a huge set of different transports and protocols like 
  SOAP WebServices, Http and JMS.
