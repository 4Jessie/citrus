  <title>Message validation</title>

  <para>In the previous sections we have seen the powerful Citrus XML message validation capabilities. The tester is able to define
  expected message behaviour on header and payload level. Later in this documentation we will also deal with XPath and XML schema validation capabilities.
  Now we deal with other message formats than XML.</para>
  
  <para>Message formats such as JSON have become very poular in the Java enterprise world. More and more interfaces are built with JSON message format. 
  Just think of RESTful WebServices and JavaScript using JSON as the message format to go for. Citrus is able to expect and validate JSON messages and 
  other formats such as Html, CSV or plaintext.</para>
