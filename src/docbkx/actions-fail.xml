    <title>Failing the test</title>

    <para>The fail action will generate an exception in order to terminate the test case with error. The test case will
    therefore not be successful in the reports.</para>
    
    <para>The user can specify a custom error message for the exception in order to describe the error cause. Here is a 
    very simple example to clarify the syntax:</para>
    
    <para><emphasis>XML DSL</emphasis></para>
    <programlisting>&lt;testcase name=&quot;failTest&quot;&gt;
    &lt;actions&gt;
        &lt;fail message=&quot;Test will fail with custom message&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/actions&gt;
&lt;/testcase&gt;</programlisting>
    
    <para>Test results:</para>
    
    <programlisting>Execution of test: failTest failed! Nested exception is: 
com.consol.citrus.exceptions.CitrusRuntimeException: 
Test will fail with custom message

[...]

CITRUS TEST RESULTS

Tests successfully:  0 (0.0%) </programlisting>

    <para>When using the Java DSL someone could think of throwing Java exceptions in the middle of configuring the test case. But this is not possible 
    as the configure method execution time is not the runtime of the Java test. During configuration you specify all test actions and the test execution time
    is done to some later state.</para>
    
    <para><emphasis>Java DSL</emphasis></para>
    <programlisting language="java">protected void configure() {
    // some test actions
    
    throw new ValidationException("This test should fail now"); // does not work as expected 
}</programlisting>

    <para>The validation exception above is directly raised before the test is able to start as the configure method does not represent the test runtime. Instead 
    of this use the fail action as follows:</para>
    
    <para><emphasis>Java DSL</emphasis></para>
    <programlisting language="java">protected void configure() {
    // some test actions
    
    fail("This test should fail now"); // fails at test runtime as expected 
}</programlisting>
