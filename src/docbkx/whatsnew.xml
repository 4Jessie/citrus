  <title>What's new?!</title>

  <para>The new Citrus release introduces new features and changes that we discuss in the following sections. We want you to get an overview of what has happened in the last release so you can
  identify the new stuff which is of interest for you.</para>
  
  <section id="whatsnew-actors">
    <title>Test actors</title>

    <para>We introduced a new concept of test actors for sending and receiving test actions. This enables you to link a test actor (e.g. interface partner application, backend application) to a test
    action in your test. Following from that you can enable/disable test actors and all linked test actions very easy. This enables us to reuse Citrus test cases in end-to-end test scenarios where
    not all interface partners get simulated by Citrus. If you like to read more about this concept follow the detailed instruction in <xref linkend="test-actors"/>.</para>

  <section id="whatsnew-soap-http-errors">
    <title>Simulate Http error codes with SOAP</title>

    <para>In case Citrus provides SOAP WebServices as a server we can now simulate Http error codes like 404 Not found and 500 Internal server error. This was not possible before so the SOAP server always responsed
    with a proper SOAP response or SOAP fault. See <xref linkend="soap-http-errors"/> for details.</para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="whatsnew-ssh">
    <title>SSH server and client</title>

    <para>The Citrus family has raised a new member in adding SSH connectivity. With the new SSH module you are able to provide a full stack SSH server. The SSH server accepts client connections and you as a tester can simulate
    any SSH server functionality with proper validation as it is known to Citrus SOAP and HTTP modules. In addition to that you can also use the Citrus SSH client in order to connect to an external SSH server. You can execute 
    SSH commands on the SSH server and validate the respective response data. The full description is provided in <xref linkend="ssh"/>.</para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="whatsnew-antrun">
    <title>ANT run test action</title>
    
    <para>With this new test action you can call ANT builds from your test case. The action executes one or more ANT build targets on a build.xml file. You can specify build properties that get passed to the ANT build and 
    you can add a custom build listener. In case the ANT build run fails the test fails accordingly with the build exception. See <xref linkend="actions-antrun"/> for details.</para>

  <section id="whatsnew-polling-interval">
    <title>Polling interval for reply handlers</title>
    
    <para>With synchronous communication in Citrus we always have a combination of a synchronous message sender and a reply handler component. These two perform a handshake when passing synchronous reply messages to the test
    for further processing such as message validation. While the sender is waiting for the synchronous response to arrive the reply handler polls for the reply message. This polling for reply messages was done in a static way 
    which often led to time delays according to long polling intervals. Now with Citrus 1.3 you can set the polling-interval for the reply handler as you like. This setting is
    valid for all reply handler components in Citrus (citrus-jms, citrus-http, citrus-ws, citrus-channel, citrus-shh, and so on).</para>
