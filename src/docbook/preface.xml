  <para>Testing an IT software can be very hard, especially when there are no sufficient tools that support you. 
  In Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) environments testing is even harder, because the tester may always be forced to simulate
  external interface applications. The simulation process of interface partners may cause severe problems regarding maintainability
  and compability. It is not unusual, that a tester has to simulate several applications manually, 
  which is very time consuming and error prone.</para>
  
  <para>The Citrus test framework helps you to perform complex integration testing in a message based EAI environment. 
  Citrus is designed to completely test whole use case scenarios in an automated way.</para>
  
  <para>This documentation provides a reference guide to all features of Citrus test framework and gives a detailed picture 
  of how to set up a EAI integration testing environment. Since this document is considered to be under construction, please feel free
