    <title>Generic action</title>

    <para>The generic &lt;action&gt; element can be placed into the action chain, in order to reference Spring beans in
    other configuration files. This enables you to add special functionality to your test case that will extend the
    usual actions that were described in the previous chapters.</para>
    
    <programlisting>
    &lt;testcase name=&quot;actionReferenceTest&quot;&gt;
        &lt;actions&gt;
            &lt;action reference=&quot;cleanUpDatabase&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;action reference=&quot;mySpecialAction&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/actions&gt;
    &lt;/testcase&gt;
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>Using this action reference you can use your own implementation of the Java interface
    com.consol.citrus.TestAction. The implementation will then be included into the test action chain as any
    other standard action.</para>
    
    <para>In the example the called referenced beans implementation will clean up the database and execute some
    custom action implementation.</para>
