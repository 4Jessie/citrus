    <title>Repeat on error until true</title>

    <para>The next looping container is called repeat-on-error-until-true. This container simply repeats group of actions 
    only in case one embedded action has failed with error. In case of such an error inside the container the loop will try 
    again to execute all embedded actions. The on-error execution will take place until one of the following conditions 
    evaluates to true:</para>
    
    <para>1. All embedded actions were processed successfully</para>
    <para>2. The ending condition evaluates to true</para>

                    &lt;message&gt;index is: ${i}&lt;/message&gt;
                &lt;/echo&gt;
                &lt;fail/&gt;
            &lt;/repeat-onerror-until-true&gt;
        &lt;/actions&gt;

    <para>In the code example the error loop will continue four times as the &lt;fail&gt; action definitely will always fail.
    The time the condition &quot;i=5&quot; evaluates to true the loop will break anyway and the whole test case will fail.</para>
