    <title>Time measurement</title>

    <para>Time measurement during a test can be very helpful. You can use the action &lt;traceTime&gt; for this
    purpose. This action should be placed several times into the action chain. The action offers the attribute
    &quot;id&quot; to identify a time line. This enables the tester to use more than one time measurements at the same
    time. If you leave out the id the action offers a default id as you can see here in the first action reference.</para>

    &lt;testcase name=&quot;timeWatcherTest_new&quot;&gt;
        &lt;actions&gt;
            &lt;traceTime/&gt;
            
            &lt;traceTime id=&quot;time_line_id&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;sleep time=&quot;3.5&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;traceTime id=&quot; time_line_id &quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;sleep time=&quot;5.0&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;traceTime/&gt;
            
            &lt;traceTime id=&quot; time_line_id &quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/actions&gt;
    &lt;/testcase&gt;
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>To print out the current elapsed time for a time line you simply have to place the &lt;traceTime&gt; action into
    the action chain again, using the respective id. The elapsed time will be printed out to the console.</para>
