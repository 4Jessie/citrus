    <para>The next action shows how to make the test framework sleep for a given amount of time. The service
    action &lt;sleep&gt; offers this functionality. Use the attribute time, to define the amount of time in seconds.
    As shown in this example decimal values are supported to specify the time to sleep. The action can also
    be used without defining a custom time delay. In this case the default delay of 5 seconds will be used.</para>
    
    <programlisting>
    &lt;testcase name=&quot;sleepTest&quot;&gt;
        &lt;actions&gt;
            &lt;sleep time=&quot;3.5&quot;/&gt;
            
            &lt;sleep/&gt;
        &lt;/actions&gt;
    &lt;/testcase&gt;
    </programlisting>
    
    <para>Once this bean was added to the action chain the framework will be delayed for the given amount of time.
    This is very useful if you need to wait for the tested application to do some work (e.g. for database entries)</para>
