  <para>Similar to templates a container element will always hold one or more test actions. In contrast to the
  template the container will be defined directly in the test case action chain, meaning that the container will
  not be referenced by more than one test case.</para>
  
  <para>Containers will execute the embedded test actions in specific logic. This can be an execution in iteration
  for instance. Different containers can easily be combined with each other to generate hierarchical
  structures. This enables the test case to implement complex execution logic. In the following the available
  containers will be described.</para>

  &containers-sequential;
  &containers-parallel;
  &containers-iterate;
  &containers-repeat;
  &containers-repeat-onerror;
