        Citrus grew out of multiple EAI software projects ConSol* was dealing
        with in the past years. The Citrus developers gained a lot of experience
        not only in testing but also in developing EAI applications. If you need
        attendance in your project regardless of which part analysis, design,
        development, testing talk to us!
