      <p>
        The Citrus development team will be glad to receive new ideas and
        improvements from you - any time. You can access the Citrus source on
        GitHub <a href="http://github.com/christophd/citrus">http://github.com/christophd/citrus</a>.
        You can fork the Citrus project on GitHub very easy in order to
        provide changes. In case you have coded extensions, bug fixes or
        simply new features, please send us a pull request from your
        repository. If you are not sure how to do it please see our 
        <a href="./quickstart.html">quickstart</a> or refer to the very good
        documentation and how-to section on GitHub (<a href="http://github.com/">http://github.com/</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you still have questions regarding Citrus development please do
        not hesitate to send us a mail regarding your problems on <b>dev@citrusframework.org</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>New code</h2>
      <p>
        In case you coded a new feature or extension we are looking forward
        to know about it! Send us your changes as pull request on GitHub 
        <a href="http://github.com/christophd/citrus">citrus@github</a>
        including unit tests (we are very serious about testing, of course)
        and a description of the feature.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Note: If you want your contributions in the official Citrus
        code repository you have to agree that your changes are released
        under the same license as Citrus uses to that time and that the
        Citrus team might change the licensing of Citrus in future.
      </p>

      <h2>Bug fixing</h2>
      <p>
        Bug fixes are also best sent to us as project fork on GitHub
        along with a bug report, so we can apply the fix to the code base.
        Please tell us the version the patch should be applied to in order to
        avoid misunderstandings. Bug fix changes must be released under the
        same license as Citrus to get involved into the code base.
      </p>

      <h2>Feature requests</h2>
      <p>
        In case you have new ideas and feature requests for Citrus but you do
        not want to implement those on your own, we will be happy to receive
        your request on the citrus-dev mailing list (<b>dev@citrusframework.org</b>).
        You can also simply open a feature request through the issue tracker
        on GitHub <a href="http://github.com/christophd/citrus/issues">http://github.com/christophd/citrus/isues</a>.
        We will discuss the benefit of the new feature with you and help you
        to get the best out of Citrus for your needs.
