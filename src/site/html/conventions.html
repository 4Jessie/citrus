        We think style matters. Not for beauty but for speaking a common
        language when talking about code and getting familiar with foreign code
        very fast. So please read this guide carefully when contributing
        extensions and patches.
      </p>
      
      <p>If you don't like a rule, open a discussion - we can always talk about changes.</p>
      
      <h3>Naming conventions</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Getters and setters
          <p>
            Name your access and setting method according to the Java Bean
            scheme. For instance use <i>getApple()</i> and <i>setApple(Apple a)</i> 
            <b>not</b> <i>fetchApple()</i> and <i>storeApple(Apple a)</i> if
            you merely want to set an object's attribute. Name the
            accessors/setter method after the object it is going to get/set if
            possible (e.g. <i>getStatus()</i> <b>not</b> <i>getMyStatus()</i>).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Class, method and member variable names
          <p>
            <b>Classes</b>, <b>Methods</b> and <b>Member variables</b> are given
            names in mixed case. There are never to capital letters adjacent.
            Remember, even acronyms like <i>'ID'</i> in class or method names
            must follow this rule. Class names always start with an upper case,
            method names and member variables always start with lower case.
          </p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">ToDo.java  // Good
TODO.java  // BAD, use camel back writing
todo.java  // BAD, as reserved

getTestId() //Good
getTestID() //BAD</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Test classes
          <p>
            Unit test classes have to end with <b>Test</b> and should live in
            the appropriate package in test scoped java resource folder.
            Example: <i>com.consol.citrus.action.SendAction</i> and <i>com.consol.citrus.action.SendActionTest</i>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Formatting</h3>
      <p>
        Code formatting is important. The rules are based on and verified by 
        <i>a href=&quot;http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/&quot;</i>Checkstyle<i>/a</i>.
        Please keep an eye on the checkstyle rules, for instance by monitoring
        the Sonar checkstyle reports generated with the continuous build or
        with local Maven checkstyle reports.
      </p>

      <p>Here are the most important rules:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Indentation
          <p>
            <b>No tabs</b>! Indentation must be 4 blanks for Java and 2 blanks for XML.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Braces
          <p>
            Curly braces <b>start on the same line as the statement</b>
          </p>
            
          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">if (foo == 12) {
    doSomething();
} else {
    doSomethingOther();
}

NOT

if (foo == 12)
{
    doSomething();
}
else
{
    doSomethingOther();
}</pre>
          <p>
            Each block must be surrounded by curly braces even if it is
            only one line. The code is more readable and more error proof, as
            you can not forget to add the braces once an extra line is added to
            the block.
          </p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">if ( a &amp;gt; 0 ) {
    b = 1;
}

NOT

if ( a &amp;gt; 0 )
    b = 1;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Don't use lines larger than 120 characters.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Logging</h3>
      <p>
        We use <i>SLF4J</i> for logging in combination with the well known <i>Log4J</i>
        API, which is provided by SLF4J. Don't use <i>System.out</i> for
        output production. Use the logging framework as System.out is
        synchronized, not flexible configurable and fills the log files with
        uncontrolled console output.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Debug level
          <p>Always check the level when using debug trace messages</p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">if(log.isDebugEnalbed()) {
   log.debug(&quot;Foo&quot;);
}</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Exceptions logging
          <p>
            Log exceptions correctly. Never use printStackTrace for
            Exceptions. Let the logging and the log configuration deal with it
            by correctly passing the exception as an additional argument.
          </p>
          
          <pre class="prettyprint linenums">...
} catch(Exception ex) {
   log.error(&quot;Foo causes a problem&quot;, ex);
   ...
}</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        Dependencies to other libraries and APIs are managed with Maven in
        various POM files. In general new dependencies go into the <i>dependencyManagement</i>
        section in the Citrus parent POM. In this dependency management
        section the version numbers are set.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Modules only reference the dependency without any version
        statement, so the version is kept in a central place. This applies to
        the most of our dependencies, only very specific dependences in a
        module can go directly into the module's POM. Here is a short
        introduction where to put new dependencies and which rules to keep in
        mind when handling Maven dependencies:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>PROJECT_HOME</b><i>/pom.xml</i>
          <p>
            Contains all available dependencies (jars) for Citrus including
            version numbers in the dependency management section.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PROJECT_HOME</b><i>/modules/citrus-tibco/pom.xml</i>
          <p>
            Contains very specific TIBCO dependency libraries only used by
            this module. Further TIBCO specific dependencies go directly in
            here. The Citrus main project should not have dependencies to TIBCO
            specific APIS and libraries.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Other Citrus modules may always reference a dependency
            defined in the dependency management section in our parent Citrus POM.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          If a new library in turn needs another new library the
          preferred way is to let Maven resolve this dependency as transitive
          dependency. So you do not have to declare the dependency's
          dependencies in the Maven POM. Only add a dependency if
          <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li>it is directly referenced in the module sources, <b>and</b></li>
            <li>it is not transitively inherited</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do you need all transitive dependencies? Think of which
            transitive dependencies could be excluded from Citrus as they are not
            needed in our project.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
