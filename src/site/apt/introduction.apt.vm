  Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) software usually take part in 
  various transactions with different interface partners. It is a very important task to test whole use case scenarios
  in order to ensure the integration into the existing software landscape of a customer.

  How can somebody ensure that applications communicate with each other in the right way? And how can somebody test 
  positive and negative use case scenarios in an automated way? Citrus aims to give answeres to these questions!

Why use Citrus?

  In normal EAI projects several applications are linked together using different interfaces in order to exchange data. 
  The communication of these interface partners is a very important test issue. In production the whole EAI system 
  has to work as expected, especially regarding the communication with different outstanding applications across 
  various transports.
 
  In order to keep the message flow alive during a use case test, all interface partners are simulated in their behaviour.
  This is not an easy challenge when dealing with different transport protocols at a time. Different protocols, technologies and
  legacy systems are therefore the beginning of many problems during the integration test.
  
  The tester may only use more or less intelligent dummy implementations of the different interface partners. In some cases the tester
  may have to interact manually during the test. An automatic verification of the sent message content and the semantically correctness 
  is not possible. The tester has to validate the success or failure of the test manually, which is very error prone and time consuming.
  
  These problems arise seemingly unsolvable challenges for the automated integration test of an EAI software. Regarding the 
  limited project schedule the tester may only be able to test one single use case manually using the available dummies. 
  In the worst case the major part of the software features is initial tested in production environment in reality.
  
  Citrus provides a tool for the testing team, that enables them to define whole use case tests in a single test describing file. 
  Incoming and outgoing messages are defined in the test specifying a message flow as it is supposed to be during the use case. All
  surrounding interface partners are simulated regardless their transport protocols (Http, JMS, TCP/IP, SOAP, ...). The tests are executed
  automatically in a continuous integration environment and give credit to the software quality during development.
