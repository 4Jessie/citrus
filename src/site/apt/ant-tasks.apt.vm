Citrus ANT tasks

  You can execute Citrus tests with ANT. The Citrus ANT tasks simplify the test execution so you just include predefined tasks 
  into your project's 'build.xml'.
  
  <<Latest stable release>>: 1.2
  
  * citrus-ant-tasks-1.2.jar ({{{./dist/citrus-ant-tasks-1.2.jar}download}})
  
  []
  
  <<Older versions>>:

  * citrus-ant-tasks-1.1.jar ({{{./dist/citrus-ant-tasks-1.1.jar}download}})
  
  * citrus-ant-tasks-1.0.jar, Note: Licensed under GPLv3 ({{{./dist/citrus-ant-tasks-1.0.jar}download}})

  The ANT tasks can execute Citrus test cases in several modes. You can either run one single test by its name or all tests in a
  test package. In addition to that you can also use TestNG XML test suite files to execute your tests.
  
  Here is a simple usage example:
  
+---
  <typedef resource="citrustasks" classpath="lib/citrus-ant-tasks-${project.version}.jar"/>
  
  <target name="citrus.run.tests" description="Runs all Citrus tests">
      <citrus package="com.consol.citrus.*"/>
  </target>
+---
  
  Following parameters are supported in the <citrus> tasks definition.
  
*----------------------*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| suitename            | The name of the test suite to execute (List of suites is also supported, separated by space        |
*----------------------*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| test                 | List of test names that should be executed (space separated list of test names)                    |
*----------------------*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| package             | List of test packages to execute. all test files in these packages are executed in this test run   |
*----------------------*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| testngXml            | TestNG XML execution file describing the tests/test suites to execute                              |
*----------------------*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  
  In the Citrus samples section you can find several 'build.xml' scripts, which give examples how to use the Citrus ANT tasks 
  in order to run tests. You can also see how single test execution is extended with ANT prompts, so the user is asked for test 
  name inputs during execution.
