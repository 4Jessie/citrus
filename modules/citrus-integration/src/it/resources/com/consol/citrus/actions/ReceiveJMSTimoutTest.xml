			In some cases it might be necessary to expect a timout when receiving a message from jms destinations. 
			For instance the tester intends to ensure that no message is sent to a certain queue. In that case the JMS 
			receive timeout would not be a test aborting error. The timout would rather be the expected behaviour.
			
			In order to validate such a timeout situation the beans receiveTimout_xxx can be used. They expect the JMS timeout
			to happen and fail if a message is received. The bean usage is very simple.
			
			The bean offers two properties:
				- timeout to declare the amount of time to wait for a message
				- destination to declare the queue to receive from
			
			Note: There are two possibilites to define thosse properties. On the one hand you can use a general timeout bean, where
			the properties have to be set in every test case as shown in the first example below. The advantage in this strategy is
			to minimize the configuration work in the service beans context, because you have one bean for many queues. On the other 
			hand you can inherit those properties from a parent bean configured in the service beans context. In this case the timeout 
			bean is only of use for one special queue (FLNManagementOut). The configuration work in the service beans context increases
			but the tester does not have to worry about queue names and other properties as shown in the second example.
